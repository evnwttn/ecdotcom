              On March 1st, 2023, ELDER CAIUS released its debut single,
              Kailash, When It Rises, a sprawling nine-minute prog anomaly
              pairing the dreamy nuances of psychedelia with filmscore elements
              and noise. Created as part of the RPM Challenge, Kailash... was
              written and self produced entirely within the month of February.

              The follow up double feature, Alien Space Bats / From Below,
              plunges deep into the murky depths of psychedelia and surfaces a
              grimier, sunken form. It features the finishing touches of
              legendary Mastering Engineer, Dan Swan√∂.

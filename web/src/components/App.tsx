              On March 1st, 2023, ELDER CAIUS released its debut single,{" "}
              <i>Kailash, When It Rises</i>, a sprawling nine-minute prog
              anomaly pairing dreamy synthesizers with elements of filmscore and
              noise. Created as part of the RPM Challenge, <i>Kailash...</i> was
              written and self produced entirely within the month of February.

              The follow up double feature,{" "}
              <i> Alien Space Bats / From Below</i>, plunges deep into the murky
              depths of psychedelia and surfaces as a grimier, sunken form. It
              features the finishing touches of legendary Mastering Engineer,
              Dan Swan√∂.
